# Project Summary Refresh Report

**Report Date:** 2026-06-29 **Report Type:** Project Summary Refresh **Generated
By:** project-summary command (refresh mode)

## Refresh Decision

- **Previous summary date:** 2026-06-27
- **Commits since:** 8
- **Files touched since:** 135
- **Structural shifts detected:** None (no new top-level dirs, no new
  `docs/architecture/` or `docs/specifications/` files, no new active
  `docs/projects/` or `docs/investigations/` entries)
- **Mode chosen:** Refresh

**Why refresh despite 135 files touched (> 60 threshold):** The file count is
inflated by archival `git mv` operations and already-documented work, not new
content. The `e16b17c` commit ("archive 7 completed projects") relocated the
entire `image-style-spell`, `glamour-v2`, and several `grapevine-*` project
folders into `_archive/` — every moved file registers as "touched." The bulk of
the remaining count is the magpie rebuild, which the 2026-06-27 summary already
fully reflects. Genuine new content since the summary is small (see below), so a
targeted patch is correct over a full re-discovery.

## Sections Patched

- **Header (Last Updated)** — bumped 2026-06-27 → 2026-06-29.
- **Core Technologies** — current version 1.13.0 → 1.14.0 (one release-please
  cut since the summary: `a4d945a`).
- **Recent Activity** — re-examined fresh (time-bounded by nature). Added
  grapevine's `triage --human` dashboard + presence-roster dedupe
  (`1b902f8`/`4117858`) and the 8 new `docs/backlog/grapevine-*` items
  (2026-06-28). Updated the release-cut tally: 13 → 14 cuts, v1.13.0 → v1.14.0.

## Sections Trusted Verbatim

- **Overview** — no dependency or framework changes.
- **Project Structure** — no top-level code dirs added/removed/renamed.
- **Documented Systems** — no `docs/architecture/` changes (still template-only
  by design).
- **Application Specifications / The Spells table** — no spell added/removed;
  the six-spell roster is unchanged.
- **Current Direction** — active projects (`magpie-rebuild`, `imago`,
  `spellbook-coherence`, `spellbook-rebrand`, `spell-architecture-maturity`,
  `digestify-image-viewer`) and zero active investigations are unchanged; the
  "Recently archived" note already records the 2026-06-28 grapevine-backlog
  retirement.
- **Development Patterns & Practices** — grimoire churn was reinforcement
  (decay-ledger, trigger-registry, two new scenarios), not a pattern change.
- **Quick Start** — no `package.json` script changes.
- **Key Insights** — no dependency or structural shift.

## Notable Changes Since Last Summary

- grapevine gained a `triage --human` dashboard (with presence-roster dedupe);
  its forward backlog moved to 8 discrete `docs/backlog/grapevine-*` items.
- Plugin released v1.13.0 → **v1.14.0**.
- Heavy archival reorganization: 7 completed projects (`image-style-spell`,
  `glamour-v2`, `grapevine-announce`/`-disposition`/`-channel-lifecycle`/
  `-operator-roll-safety`, `media-forge-cli-gaps`) plus `grapevine-backlog`
  moved into `_archive/` — bookkeeping, not direction change.
